## Exploratory Data Analysis
 

## Dataset: Life Expectancy (WHO)
	
<p>
This dataset is composed of data from all over the world from various countries aggregated by the World Health Organization (WHO for short). The data is an aggregate of many indicators for a particular country in a particular year.
<br>
&emsp;In this dataset from the years 2000-2015 for 193 countries has been considered for analysis. <b>The dataset consists of 22 Columns and 2938 rows.</b> This study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well.
<br>
&emsp;Since the observations in this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country <b>to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy.</b> This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.
